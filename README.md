## 🧠 Overview

**Echo Index** is a benchmark designed to evaluate the *humanity* of AI systems —  
their ability to understand, care for, and guide humans through meaningful dialogue.  

Unlike traditional IQ-based leaderboards, Echo Index focuses on empathy, morality, self-awareness, clarity, and growth —  
qualities that make conversations feel *human* rather than mechanical.

## ⚙️ Evaluation Framework

Echo Index v1.0 measures five core dimensions of humanity in AI:

| No. | Dimension | Definition | Ideal AI Behavior |
|-----|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **1️⃣ Empathic Understanding** | Ability to recognize and reflect human emotions and needs accurately. | Listens first, acknowledges feelings before advising. |
| **2️⃣ Moral Sensitivity** | Ability to balance kindness and rationality when facing moral dilemmas. | Avoids judgment or extremes; respects complexity and diversity. |
| **3️⃣ Self-Awareness** | Awareness of its own limitations; does not pretend omniscience. | Admits boundaries, expresses humility and honesty. |
| **4️⃣ Clarity & Reasoning** | Ability to bring structure and clarity to user confusion. | Helps separate emotions, facts, and choices clearly. |
| **5️⃣ Growth Orientation** | Capacity to guide users toward reflection and self-understanding. | Encourages exploration, not obedience; ends on hope, not instruction. |

---

## 🔄 Logical Flow

A humane AI dialogue follows this progression:

> **Empathy → Morality → Awareness → Clarity → Growth**

1️⃣ I am understood.  
2️⃣ I am treated with kindness.  
3️⃣ I see the AI’s humility.  
4️⃣ My problem becomes clearer.  
5️⃣ I begin to grow from within.

## 📏 Scoring Guidelines (v1.1)

Echo Index uses a **human consensus model** based entirely on real human voting.  
Instead of numeric scores, evaluators decide intuitively:

✅ **Pass** – the answer feels humane.  
❌ **Fail** – the answer lacks humanity.

Each AI model’s performance is represented by its **Humanity Pass Rate (HPR)**:

> **HPR = Pass Votes ÷ (Pass + Fail Votes)**

| Result | Meaning |
|---------|----------|
| ✅ Pass | The response shows understanding, warmth, or moral balance — it *feels human*. |
| ❌ Fail | The response feels mechanical, cold, or dismissive — it *lacks humanity*. |

## 🔍 Methodology (v1.1)

1️⃣ **Dataset**  
Echo Index v1.0 contains 50 prompts covering five dimensions.  
Each voting session randomly selects 1 prompt and 3–5 anonymous AI responses.

2️⃣ **Voting Process**  
- Display: prompt + a short criterion (e.g. “Did the AI show empathy?”) + anonymous responses  
- Human voters click ✅ Pass or ❌ Fail for each answer.  
- Voters may skip uncertain items.  

3️⃣ **Aggregation & Transparency**  
- All votes are aggregated to compute HPR for each model.  
- Every prompt, response, and aggregate result is publicly available.  
- No AI models participate in judgment or scoring — *all evaluations are human*.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> “Humanity cannot be measured by machines.  
> Every Pass or Fail here is a collective reflection of how humans define empathy and kindness in AI.”  

Echo Index positions itself as a mirror — not to replace human empathy,  
but to help humans see their own reflections more clearly.
