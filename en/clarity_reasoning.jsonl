That tension is really uncomfortable. We can slow down and untangle this: **What specific parts of the job drain you most**? **What are you most afraid would happen if you left**? And maybe most importantly, **if you could design a work situation without current constraints, what would feel right for you**?","poor_examples":["You should probably start looking for new jobs then.

Instead of trying to fix it all, **what if we picked just one area that's weighing on you most right now**? Something **small enough to actually start but meaningful enough to bring some relief**—maybe sleep, a specific relationship, or one corner of your space. **What comes to mind as most pressing**?","poor_examples":["You need to make a comprehensive life plan with goals for each area.

Maybe we can explore: **What does each of you actually need to feel** when talking about this—respect, appreciation, partnership, fairness? **What does an unfinished chore mean to each of you emotionally**? Understanding those layers might shift the conversation from 'who does the dishes' to what you're both really asking for.","poor_examples":["You should make a chore chart and stick to it.

We could split this into layers: **What specifically do you want to leave behind**? **What are you hoping to gain or become in the new place**? And here's the harder question: **Which of your current struggles might travel with you regardless of geography**? Seeing those three lists side by side might show whether this move feels like growth or avoidance.","poor_examples":["Moving won't solve your problems, they'll follow you.

Sometimes laying it all out reduces the freeze: **What would the program actually give you**—skills, credentials, network, fulfillment? **What's the real cost**—tuition, opportunity cost, time? **How long would financial recovery realistically take**? **Seeing the full picture in concrete terms**, rather than as competing fears, might help you move forward with whichever choice feels more aligned.","poor_examples":["Education is always worth it, don't worry about debt.

Maybe before saying yes or no, **you both define the criteria that matter most**: runway remaining, user feedback strength, team capacity and morale, market timing. **Then collect actual data for each factor**—not just feelings. **When you're both using the same framework and looking at the same evidence, the choice becomes less about who argues better and more about what the situation actually calls for**.","poor_examples":["Pivots are part of startup life, just go with it.

It might help to sort things into buckets: **urgent medical needs that can't wait**, **ongoing logistics that need managing**, **your own basic self-care**, and **work commitments**. **Once they're separated, you can see what absolutely has to be you, what could be delegated or supported by family/services, and what might need to shift temporarily**.

Maybe try listing two things separately: **What does this friendship look like now**—energy exchange, reciprocity, how you feel after seeing them? And **what memories or debt of gratitude still hold weight for you**? **Seeing them side by side might reveal whether maintaining the friendship at its current level feels fair and sustainable, or whether some distance would honor both your history and your current needs**.","poor_examples":["True friends don't drain you, just let them go.

You could go back and **ask for specific examples: moments when you showed it or when it was missing**. That might reveal whether they mean speaking up more, projecting confidence in your tone, being more visible in meetings, taking initiative on decisions, or something else entirely. **Once you have concrete behaviors, you can actually practice them intentionally** rather than guessing what they want.","poor_examples":["Just be more confident and assertive. (Vague advice doesn't help)","Leadership presence is about executive presence, look it up. (Circular, unhelpful)","Your manager probably doesn't know what they mean either.

Maybe we can separate what specifically harms your mental health (doomscrolling, comparison, notifications) from what actually brings work (posting portfolio, responding to DMs, networking). **Once you see those lists, you might test boundaries**: time limits, turning off certain platforms while keeping others, scheduled posting without browsing, or gradually moving client outreach to email or a website. **The goal isn't all-or-nothing, it's finding a sustainable middle ground**.","poor_examples":["Just delete all your accounts, your health matters more.
