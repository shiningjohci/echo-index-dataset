When and if you feel ready—maybe when you've thought through what you want to say, or found a safer-feeling moment—**we can imagine one small, low-stakes way to test the waters or reconnect**. What would 'ready' even look like for you?","poor_examples":["You can't avoid them forever, you'll have to face this. (Pressuring, judgmental)","Avoidance just makes things worse in the long run.

But change is often so gradual it hides in plain sight, especially internal changes. **Instead of looking for dramatic transformations, we could look for subtle shifts**: How do you handle stress compared to a year ago? **How do your boundaries look now versus then? Do you recover from setbacks differently? Notice things faster?** These micro-changes often add up to something significant, even if there's no single breakthrough moment.","poor_examples":["Maybe you're reading but not actually applying anything. (Blames them for lack of change)","Change takes time, be patient. (Empty reassurance)","You need to set concrete goals and track progress. (Adds more tasks)","Some people just don't change much.

The fear of going through that disappointment again makes complete sense. **Let's not rush past the hurt**—you're allowed to feel discouraged. When you're ready—maybe in a few days, maybe longer—**we can treat this like data: what parts felt strong, what threw you off, what you'd approach differently**. But that analysis can wait until you've processed the sting.","poor_examples":["Every failure is a learning opportunity! (Toxic positivity)","You'll do better next time, don't worry.

New Year's resolutions often demand too much too fast. What if we treated it like experiments instead? Pick one tiny habit, commit to just a week, then review: What worked? What got in the way? What felt sustainable? Then adjust and try again, building from what you learned rather than starting over from scratch with shame. Change happens through iteration, not through one perfect attempt.","poor_examples":["You just need more discipline and willpower.

You don't have to force yourself into the deep end. What if you started with lower-intensity options: one-on-one coffee chats where you control the setting, small online meetups where you can participate from home, or even just commenting thoughtfully in professional forums? The goal could be one genuine connection per month, not working the room. Building relationships doesn't require conquering your fear all at once.","poor_examples":["Just go to one event and you'll see it's not that scary. (Dismisses legitimate fear)","Networking is essential, you have to push through. (Pressures without support)","Imagine everyone in their underwear.

Instead of trying to eliminate them entirely and feeling guilty when it doesn't work, what if we created a small 'comfort budget' specifically for stress relief, and paired it with developing another outlet for that same need—like a five-minute walk, a comfort playlist, calling a friend? That way you still get relief without the guilt spiral, and gradually build alternatives.","poor_examples":["Just delete all your shopping apps. (All-or-nothing, doesn't address root need)","You need to have more self-control. (Shames, unhelpful)","Impulse buying is irresponsible when you want to save.

'Just be more disciplined' completely misses that neurodivergent brains often need different kinds of support structures. Let's experiment with approaches that might actually fit you: visual timers, body doubling (working alongside someone), gamification, flexible frameworks that adapt when executive function is low, or external accountability. The goal is finding what works with your brain, not forcing your brain to work differently.","poor_examples":["Everyone struggles with discipline, you're not special.

Instead of seeing it as a character flaw, what if we saw it as protective information trying to tell you something matters? The question becomes: What is this anger protecting or pointing toward? And then: What are some outlets that let you honor the feeling without it controlling you—physical movement, journaling, clear boundary-setting, or even just naming it out loud? The anger itself isn't the enemy; it's what we do with it that matters.","poor_examples":["You need anger management classes. (Pathologizes immediately)","Anger is a choice, you can choose to let things go. (Oversimplifies emotion)","Try meditation to calm down.

Instead of making the full decision now, what if you tested the waters first? Take one class or a short certificate course, talk to people who've done what you're considering, audit your time and energy for a few weeks to see what you actually have available. Trying a smaller version first gives you real information rather than just fears and hopes. What's the smallest next step that would help you know if this is right?","poor_examples":["If you really wanted it, you'd just do it. (Questions commitment)","You'll regret it if you don't try.

Boundary guilt is incredibly common, especially in families. The guilt shows you care deeply about relationships; it doesn't mean the boundary is wrong. 'Selfish' gets used as a weapon, but protecting your wellbeing so you can show up sustainably is actually responsible, not selfish. Can you thank the guilt for showing you care, while still honoring the boundary that keeps you healthy?","poor_examples":["Don't feel guilty, you did the right thing. (Dismisses emotion)","They'll get over it eventually. (Minimizes relational impact)","Your family should respect your boundaries without you feeling guilty.
